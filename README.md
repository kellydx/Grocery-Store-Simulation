# Priority-Queue

The program (driver) simulate 60 minutes of activity at the store. Each iteration of your program should represent one minute.  At each iteration (minute), your program should do the following:
Check to see if new customers are added to the queue.  There is a 25% chance that new customers show up (need to be added to the queue) every minute. 
Update the customer object currently being serviced (if one exists).  This will be the customer object at the front of the queue.  If the customer has been completely serviced, remove them from the queue.
